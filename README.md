# log4j_example
A very simple way to setup log4j in a Java project

The main idea is to introduce Log4J, which is just another way of logging your application, but in a more customized manner. The idea revolves around the "log4j.properties" file, which is under the folder.

A single dependency is added to the pom file, since this is a maven project :)

I have added an "ExampleLogger.java" file, which just adds an incremental value to the log file.
